    "transcript": "welcome back everyone right let's kick off this year's geo guessing bonanza from where we left off it's a diverse world 30 seconds per round with some of you will be pleased to hear a couple of minor tweaks the first off being the link to the game so that you can play a long okay and I will discuss that further in a sec just before we start because it's it's complicated it's not the perfect scenario the other one being yes I am allowed to move around and up and down the road which was kindly pointed out in huge numbers by you guys I don't know why I forgot that force of habit I would imagine let's go ahead and get these 30 seconds on the clock the score to beat is 17 7 5 7 now here is the actual URL for this game the one I'm about to play ok the links in the description also so if you want to play along as in before you watch the video of course then go ahead but it might ruin the video a little bit knowing where I'm gonna guess so it's up to you you could play it one round at a time so you don't know who's won until right at the end but you see it's still gonna tarnish the video somewhat so I'll leave it up to you for now and we'll play it by ear let's do this challenge in the mean time okay we've got a blurry forest good it's loaded that will help somewhat so yeah if I want to I can move down this road but I mean do I need to move those sometimes is it better just to study the place especially when it isn't loading for  ok I can't see a house down there now I'm going Finland for this one folks yeah I'm just gonna go here in Finland ok was Finland near to the Bourdon of Sweden though quite far quite considerably further north and where I clicked but 3 9 8 1 you know that that isn't terrible it's pretty good 260 1.9 miles you guys a lot of you will be beating me if you went for the north of Finland or the north of Sweden but it's early days it's a good platform to build on so on we go whoo-hoo this is exciting okay oh god I wish you would load quicker when I have my new internet guys this won't be a problem but my God look at this I don't know what to say about this where's the Sun where is he he's there so kind of in the southern hemisphere okay six seconds left I'm going for Thailand yeah there why have I click there oh wow that's why that's why that is so jammy okay we were actually in Lao and maybe that's why I click there is because I did have a round in Lao not so long ago I got a year an hour or so ago something like that and that swayed me not that it really looked like that but I don't know a stroke of luck seventy seven point four miles four six seven five points so who's beating me who's playing along round by round and who's beating me it's exciting if anyone's beating me then Fairplay but this could crumble at any any round any second I could get a zero score point you never know so we'll carry on then this is exciting I am excited personally for my own school and I'm sure some of you are too to see if you can beat me right now this is looking bit Russian / Ukrainian Sun firmly in the southern hemisphere I think I've just got to study I've got to put less emphasis I'm moving around although we do have a lorry yeah I think I've got to go for let's go for Russia but around here somewhere it was just a very poor road in Latvia as it happens near Bouska and near the border with Lithuania but yeah that did throw me off to be honest the the farmland and the surroundings looked a hell of a lot like Poland Lithuania that sort of thing I probably would have gone Poland if it weren't for the road it just looked like a Russian road the way that the concrete just kind of crumbles but three to nine nine points isn't terrible we weren't that far away I guess so yeah onwards and upwards I'm not gonna talk too much I think mainly cuz I'm just so excited to get from Rance around here we go here's the next one 11 955 is the score we are on we have a sign here who's going to make full advantage of this sign school zone what does that look like oh my god we have this one too I've got to be quick though I've got to be quick if it'll load that would be great I can't read it I've got to get closer this isn't gonna work is it okay I'm going South Korea I don't know one second left okay good oh my god I'm so relieved forty nine point three miles that's really good even by South Korean standards really frustrating how my imagery won't load it's just the internet speed I've got at the moment it will be rectified a promise in a couple of videos time but yeah that is that's a good one I think I just went on the green sign I'm not gonna sit here and lie and say that I understand the difference between the the symbols yet but looking at them the circles which I did see on that sign do seem to be a lot more prevalent in the South Korean thingamajig could have also looked at which road we were which side of the road we were on that would have helped why is the map different in North Korea it's really cool I like the way it looks it's actually harder to use a think but maybe that's just because I'm used to the other math but a last round guys I think yeah last round here we go concentrate concentrate it's Africa look at that afro blown in the wind can't stop to look though I've got to get this right I've got to do well here oh my god I'm thinking Kenya because it reminds me of those when they look at the rubbish in the tips where's the Sun I've got ten seconds son is there yeah I'm going Kenya get in there nice and quick let's go there near Nairobi make guess I can't wait any longer get in oh my word four nine one one points it was Kenya and it was near Nairobi in a place called well yeah it's Naro be and what did it for me was purely adverts where you see young kids in Kenya scouring the rubbish tips I couldn't really get my words out during the game but yes scouring those rubbish tips and quarries and places where rubbish is dumped and the poor kids they're scouring the place for you know any sort of salvageable stuff maybe even eating the food I don't know but um I don't even think we were at a waste tip to be honest but yet that's what did it and lo and behold that's where we were Nairobi I should have just clicked in the middle of Nairobi really I would have got an insane score not that that wasn't one view summary twenty one six five six well that's gonna take some beating isn't it on future games that's for sure but yeah job done and really pleased with my score just looking at some of those very lucky at times to be honest in terms of you guys who have played along let me know how the experience was and how you think we can improve it you know it's only January the fourth we're still in the early stages of this system that we're gonna get right but yeah give us your genius ideas as to how we can enhance this experience for everyone obviously it's never going to be perfect you guys can just play the map after you've watched my video and get a perfect score and you'll be top of the leaderboard so you know it's never going to be a perfect system in that sense unless geoguessr maybe come up with one themselves but it's just about you guys you honest guys out there getting the best that you can out of this experience so yeah give me your feedback hope you enjoyed the vid and there'll be lots more of these to come and as soon as my internet is ready more perfect scores more world city Wednesday's more home town roulette the lot so yeah until Monday folks take it easy and have a good weekend setup ",

    "transcript": "an urban world an urban world where a putrid thought much of the globe whether we like it or not though is covered by urban areas towns cities and I'm gonna explore them on this map made by mapper I believe but I think he's changed his name to have a go at this hint a Meister guy I don't know whether he actually does cheat I'm gonna stay out of that one but I'm gonna play this and I'm gonna play it no moving around I think yeah so I can I get confused with these terms I can scroll and zoom but I can't actually move my position why well I think - there might be some funny people lurking about so we can take the piss out of them and I think we'll just be able to use good clues and stuff that are around us it may take a while but you know there is potential to get good scores and when I say good scores I mean 22,000 plus potentially potentially so let's do it there's no time limit on this because we need that time to study our surroundings now just quickly while I do this still no good internet really sorry I'm not going to name and shame the provider yet but yet it means no home time roulette or world city Wednesday's on Wednesday it'll just be more of this so you know that might please some of you and the rest of you just shut up and be patient all right it's coming the Internet people are coming this week to fix the new Internet in the time being let's do this where are we gonna be how urban a world is mappers world in his little French head I ding ding ding and a ping ping ping we've got a pirate show here and that is one language that I could not tell you what that is is it's is that Hebrew yeah I don't know let's have a look around could be some sort of Lebanon script we will see well hopefully we will anyway but yeah this is different there's a lot going on here I've got a picture of a dog pooing here and it looks to be a red poo that has squeezed out of his little tight bum hole not entirely sure what the intended message is there but whatever it is surely it belongs in a veterinary leaflet not on the side of a road so we've had a Jewish pirate a very very ill dog okay are there any flags that's what I'm thinking at the moment and as I'm looking around it does it look he's Rayleigh I guess it could be just looks quite vast yeah definitely could be look at that it reminds me of the text you would get in Israel not that I've been we've got yeah we've got people so we can we can analyse the people here how do ish do they look that's the question how Jewish does this guy look well that's Ross from friends circa 1994 so what about these that could be a fresh Bank check that this older chap is clutching can't see the figure though so it's it's tough what have we got here Bank H a that could be Haifa couldn't it Maccabi Haifa what else have we got Jewish Pete's a guy okay yeah sure they exist eel at that is that is an Israeli thing isn't it definitely okay all right I'm gonna go for this where is a lat hang on a minute let's have a look at that Bank sat an AI F or is it a h AF I think if we're being honest with ourselves it's a HAF or even a H a P so a hi fer probably isn't where we are so look down here there's a lat so could we be here let's see could be couldn't we yeah he lat let's go for real up then yeah I thought it was an a for a minute right let's have a look we might even be able to do a bit better than just randomly guess well if that yeah I think the C is down there somewhere so I think I've got to be over here somewhere I am going to select where am I going to select that's the question I think I'm gonna go on this road here can you imagine here we go wait a minute we can do better we can do better than this so we go back yeah we've got the bank heavenly we can work this out guys we know we're looking eastwood over the sea we know that much could you be here can't see the bank there and there's no road that carries on prison no not quite we need a bank and now we're at the airport no I think we're probably down here but we're definitely not on that one and then if we move down further we're out of town we're out of it hmm could be further up here couldn't we could be further up here there's Bank apollon hey hang on a minute this is where we are isn't it we're here mate I'm going for it let's get as close as we possibly can we've got the edge of the building we have this is ridiculous there we go Wow three metres I do not believe it to be honest well done if you beat that oh wait you can't have done let's move on then Wow I said there was potential for good scores here I didn't think there would be a potential for a perfect score Xerox Rama Rama South that is Portuguese but we're probably not in Portugal because there's a hairy-chested Brazilian drug baron lurking in his doorway which is slightly too high for the path I think it's fair to say maybe he's got a fear of midgets breaking into his house stealing all his cocaine Oh God who else have we got got this wiseguy here with his shades and his shirt could also be a drug lord actually I'm not being very fair to Brazilians am I really okay we'll keep looking what are the cars saying that one isn't saying a lot that's feeling a bit sorry for itself to be honest I've got a Chevrolet I think we know we're in Brazil to be honest L entrada say daddy vehicle asprova door station are how are we going to find out where we are can this offer us anything a Lugo Salas are we in a place called a Lugo well let's look out for that word again so Tommy INGOs okay I presume that that's Sundays and Fridays something like that a Luger see it says there a Luger SAE hmm so are we in a place called Eluga that's what I'm wondering good luck finding it on the map but you know that could be where we are so yeah good luck what's that yeah I think I'm gonna spend a bit of time guys on the map trying to find a Luger just because I got off to such a good start now if that is SAE where was it a Luger se are there any states in Brazil that have se that could stand for se let's have a look si se no no no no no no no no no no Sal Paulo no Santa Catarina no no but we're definitely in Brazil Rio Grande do Sul no there's nothing here that could be SAE I don't think Oh I found one Sergey pay let's have a look in there let's look for a place called a Luger you never know you just never know I'll be very disappointed if I don't find it now but you know we're gonna give it a go and that's all we can do let's check the coastline shall we a Luger let's have a look here give me a minute please I think we're sufficiently zoomed here that we would see a Luger so if we can't find it at this altitude then I don't think it exists so don't forget guys that could mean something completely different that might not be a place so but SAE hmm special edition who knows agua Oh God that had me go in there where is the where is the edge of this state I think I've lost it there it is okay so I can't find it still can't find it in my head this is 80% a wild goose chase but I'm always the optimist so I'm looking anyway am I still in the right think no I think of I think I've moved over into the next one there to be honest I think this river is the border we'll have one more little luck over here SEC even the roads are named se that gives me more hope it really does please God let me find it come on Eluga the elusive Eluga come on Santa Lucia we've looked down here so it's getting desperate now the fact that the roads were called se spurred me on a bit but really really it's not looking too hopeful purely now because I haven't I just haven't found it and I think I would have found it by now you never know it could be a very small place that I would have had to have zoomed in on even more okay what do we do do you make it guess do I go into the main town here this one it might be a little area of this town Eluga come on Eluga okay right we're done I'm just going to click in this town then folks and here goes nothing I'm really really excited to see really curious rather I'm not excited cuz I think I've done [ __ ] I'm really curious to see where we actually were here we go oh man aha Recife so actually that ain't a bad score but um receive a interesting was Eluga the area I don't think he actually was was it that's crazy so what has that got to do with se or did that must have just meant something else they must have done but anyway that's quite lucky if we zoom out not terrible really not terrible so that might have been a huge stroke of luck a huge coincidence but we'll move on anyway okay third round looks like France judging by these little house numbers can we read this rue adore Anne I think it says what is that in there that my that may well be a nude artist classed a nude drawing class can you believe it look it is it is there's no way they would have those pictures up there if it was just a regular old classroom that is crazy who would have thought I would ever come across that I've seen it all now unbelievable and this guy's having it look he's undoing his trousers he actually is to her look he's just about to cross the road get his in fact what he is that I hope that's his thumb I hope to god that's his thumb we'll leave it there yeah we'll face the other way I think right see if there's any flags I'm pretty sure in flat flats France Oh goddamn all frosted okay we've got rue a Duran the infamous route a Duran what else have we got that is definitely French I don't think we're in Belgium I think guys we're just going to have a look have to look at the architecture and try and decipher whether this is just north or south if there were some football paraphernalia flags stickers that would help me what does that say Abe not sure but there's nothing really Esther put it away that reminds me of the side of Metz Cathedral the way that the road comes down because I've been to Metz but actually it kind of looks nothing like it as well but I am gonna go quite north in France so let's shut up and get in there yes that is indeed what she said okay so I'm thinking of going yeah Mel I go Mets or is that that would be bold I've mentioned it so much now I feel like I have to thing is with that though if it's over there I'm gonna get it pretty over there in breasts grow up guys then I'm gonna get a pretty poor score so what shall I do so I go lemons something like that lamal ruin do a play it safe ah yeah I think I'm gonna go Lamar Lamar Lemmons I'm gonna say I would damn well like here we go there's a cathedral here let's just go there even though the names are wrong here we go Leon Wow Leon annoyingly that would have been well it would have been about the same two Mets probably closer it didn't look that far south I have to be honest I spent a week in Leon actually so I'll be interested to know where that was up there was it fair enough I had a torrid time in Leon I ended up sleeping on a station platform I won't go into it but it ended up all right at the end three six seven five points correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that worse than my previous score of the last round surely not I guess that is pretty far isn't it that is pretty far anyway yeah I think most of you will have gone fairly north in France some of you will have just clicked in the middle and some of you have already watched the video and probably clicked in Leon naughty let's carry on well done if you're still up to my level at this point I'm sure a lot of you will be right what have we got here and you are trading what is this language men GL Baron parabot electronic okay what is that is that Malaysian or some sort of Filipino that's what I'm thinking so far Nizam seems to be a prolific figure around here getting his name down wherever he can Nizam I know it's of no consequence but you know what kind of name is that it's a Malaysian name I don't know I don't know why I'm asking myself write something for went for went eh sounds more Spanish could be Filipina ah here we go this could be of use troomph all equipment spare parts Sdn Bhd and there's like oriental looking symbols on there Sdn Bhd troomph I'll what are we thinking here I don't think they have that in the Philippines it's too Spanish influenced so I'm thinking thinking a lot of things and I'm saying I'm thinking a lot is that a flag that looks like it could be the malaysian flag so we'll carry on tom file i'm hoping is the city or place because then i can try and find it now she has got a muslim headscarf on so yeah they made muslim in malaysia nice am i should have known that does sound quite Islamic right let's um let's get over here then let's try and find because my other option is Indonesia now but I'm gonna no no it's not no they wouldn't have the oriental symbols what am I talking about let's have a look on the main bit of Malaysia the more populated bit and try and find this place this elusive tongued file true or is it true true pal whatever there's the border so trooll pal now Oh chump at not a million miles away hopefully trump our trump ah that's Singapore down there we'll leave that alone I wonder if we near Kuala lumper we could be couldn't we we could be in an area of Kuala Lumpur for all we know Trump all but a good luck finding it if it is okay I've had a quick scan over here can't really find anything at the moment I may have gone over it you guys may have seen it mm-hmm yeah that looks more countryside a to be honest what about down here this looks quite built up anybody know dust okay let's move over to this part of Malaysia how about that okay look at the names - they look more or less similar they look different to be honest they look more Indonesian I think they look that yeah more sort of pimping ping pong pong sort of thing I know thank you yeah very accurate I know yeah I'm tempted do we look over here I don't think we do do we no no no no no no I think we are on this somewhere so I think I'm gonna go for it what was that place tongue Pat so anything in that like is that there is that our name for thump I'll probably not okay I'm gonna have to click somewhere aren't I so I'm gonna go over here can we is there any clue as to where the sea is if the sea is nearby I don't think so what's that Malaysia I should have seen that earlier I mean it wouldn't have made a difference but so Kimmy Tyrion Cassie natin Malaysia they may not be places Sdn Bhd again look that's that's on there Sdn Bhd so they're different buildings they're different you know companies shops or establishments but they've still got the Sdn Bhd so what does that tell you what about the regions hmm definitely in Malaysia there aren't we these are the areas look Kelantan Barak about this one kadar Sdn Bhd what's this one doesn't say Oh yo ho yo ho your [ __ ] Sdn Bhd Sabah no I'm not going to go on that island I'm gonna go over here like I said I would I don't think there's anything else that can really sway it so I'm gonna go down here somewhere near Center Wang just for the sake of it here we go ah for pete's sake we were on this one in tau damn it all damn it all okay one 404 points that is shocking how can Malaysia spam that much area I don't know Oh God last round we've got to claw this back somehow to a respectable kind of 18,000 if we can right we've got big mountains in the background rue it Deschamps did tab back but are we in France yes we could be we could be by the Alps it's looking quite Alpine right Jedi Ron koalas okay said I Ron cross could be in Switzerland to be fair not ruling that out Gessler see that sounds quite German which could be Swiss it's bass province centre D something can't read it ha that seems to be a big bridge over there that is definitely a bridge sir we've got a river running through and a train track rod we hmm and there's a motorway there z.i aéroport what could that be said I let's have a look Zurich that be Zurich they are big mountains I have to say Zurich Airport but that would be in the German part so no I don't think so said I what does that mean general direction that could mean that couldn't it aéroport could that be Geneva's or basil's hmm could be Geneva couldn't it where's the airport in Geneva there it is for God this is tough only because I want to maintain I want to end on a high note I want to beat you [ __ ] all right you know I don't want anything average what's this over here it's all French there's no mistake in that I'm stuck I really am stuck here what can give it away what can possibly give this away I would love for there to be a dot France or a dot Switzerland website thingamajig I would love that but I don't think there is ah Airport Geneva hang on a minute if we can find ronk was then that will do it werenít Ron coifs could be over here these are big mountains Hubert Hubert and Ron coifs anywhere to be seen can't see him Airport have a look by um no there's no point looking by Zurich it's too German what do we do could be around here some money good to get an airport down here I'm looking for Ron Cross and Sint Hubert just because it's so mountainous over here there's Beaufort yeah what's the other place that's got an airport that's quite near to the Alps Grenoble that's it so could we be at Grenoble Airport hmm no I don't think so got to make a decision then okay so tempted to look for sin Hubert and ronk was got to go for a pic though I'm gonna go over here somewhere okay we weren't far my god we were in Switzerland over by sea on can't see ronk was or sent whatever it was anyway but I'm pretty damn happy with that because I think I've cracked the 18,000 that I was talking about let's view the summary yes easily and I don't think many people wear we'll have got quite as close as that so yeah I'm pleased overall guys that was pretty fun 1862 six was the score well done if you beat it without cheating of course some tough rounds there the Brazil one was tough that last one was quite tough the Malaysian one as well I think a lot of you will have also gone on this island yeah but well done if you beat me and tell us what you think of this format got a really good Sparkle quiz for you on Wednesday involving UK counties and on Friday it's another 30 seconds diverse wealthy to look forward to so tune in tell your friends share spread the word about this new addictive craze we've come up with see you later guys take it easy tada ",

you get a quick format something like that fun formats whatever they may be we're going to finish things off with a diverse world 30 seconds per round and as usual I will put the link in the description so you can play along the same as last Friday so yippee right here we go let's start the challenge 30 seconds copy your beautiful little code I think I'll do well to be last week's score guys I think it's safe to say but you never know what we might get here we go upon this click of this button we will be away here we go some of you will have already done this round of course ok what cars have we got well can I have even have I even got time to look at the cars I don't know I can't even see what they are Nissan or [ __ ] Fiat another fear do we go Italy do I'll go Italy I've got 10 seconds yeah I'm gonna have to go Italy just because of all the Fiats Melania it's gonna be a [ __ ] guess oh wow no it's not whoa ok that's insane so we were in Modena 26.3 miles away that's that's crazy that's going insane guesses right yeah I don't know what I'm even looking at here I'm just kind of blown away four eight eight seven points Modena I went for belong yeah mainly because I had about two seconds left maybe even one and I just click click belong you because I've been there and it's a cool City yeah check it out if you're ever doing a tour of Italy but yeah Modena isn't that where they make Ferrari I don't know that might be wrong anyway well done if you be in that pool yeah I think we just gonna have to carry on and see if we can keep that up here we go I've got a climbed up a wall like that once to get to a service station right I can move of course which I forgot to do in the first round what does this say didn't need to move did I naeun okay that looks Japanese I was driving on the left or the right I don't think I'm gonna be able to find out yeah we're driving on the left so it's definitely Japan seven seconds I'm gonna go quite north here mountains okay my little change at the last second was pretty ineffective it wouldn't have mattered yeah that's the thing with Japan you can be so far away but to be honest I'm just grateful that I didn't go for the top island the North Island because I was thinking about it not sure why I think it was just the trees but clearly whatever I think about that is wrong so yeah we were down here in these mountains not too far from places like kobe kyoto nagoya yeah that that looks like a pretty wild joseph land down there with some pretty big old mountains looks beautiful three three four nine points it ain't great a lot of you will have beaten that because you will have gone for japan and you will have been sensible and gone in the middle right next round folks well done if you are beating me on those two rounds here we go here's the third mm-hmm okay we've got a couple of whippersnappers on this bike do I move do I move or do I just come on let's move and then we'll study this bit come on load Philippines okay good Philippines that's very useful to say the least I'm looking quickly for that no I'm going there here goes nothing yeah fairly far away I guess I was drew desperately looking for the place that I could see on the sign the place name I can't for the life of me remember what it was I guess or something have a look nope son Philippe but yeah at least I got the right city at least I thought to move I guess a lot of you will have two three four seven - yeah again it's it's okay it's okay grateful to get the right country yeah right fourth round guys again if you beat your meat well done it's gonna be tight I believe with some of us right LP 207 what is that is where's the Sun [ __ ] I don't know where the hell I am where is the Sun ah [ __ ] right above us LP is that a Spanish thing I don't know I don't think this is Spain is it I'm gonna mess this up I know it I'm going Spain of course of course if I had more time I may have worked that out an LP stands for la palma la palma which is one of the lesser known canary islands the more famous ones being Gran Canaria for to Ventura is that Tenerife Lanza Rossi and where's Tenerife then is that it anyway the other ones Tenerife and that one La Palma you just don't hear about but yeah I should have worked that out with the valve all Kanak kind of ground and sand and dirt but at least I click Spain I honestly think I had naught point two seconds to go there when I click that so and I clicks right in the middle as well nowhere near the sea which kind of proves how desperate I was okay we've got one more round to go daddy's a very poor school by the way I don't know why I'm so chirpy most of you well not most of you but a lot of you will be beating me so I've got to end on a high here I started on a high in Italy in Modena I've got to end in a high here we go oh jesus oh Jesus what are we thinking where's the Sun is that the Sun over there that's in the northern hemisphere I'm thinking Argentina then yes I'm gonna go Argentina how far north or we did you think okay I'm going up here how about that here goes nothing oh it's not bad daddy's ending on a high in my book definitely 155 miles north Ness and South nurse was excellent for three six seven getting you summary 17 8:47 nowhere near as good as the score last week but I think that was a bit of a freak score to be honest I'm very happy with that yeah the Italy one being the pick of the bunch the Argentine one being the second best I think then the Philippines I guess I've got to put that last but you know at least I went with Spain I think a lot of you might not have gone for Spain because you you know if you didn't get the the style of the sign right which is the only thing I went on the style of the sign with the lp then the number then obviously it looks nothing like Spain I think it looks more like Iceland to be honest than Spain and so a lot of you will have gone for some pretty wacky places there I think and that's fine I don't blame you it's only because I've been traveling Spain recently and and I've done a Spain perfect score that I know those signs yeah but I hope you enjoyed that one guys as always keep the feedback and keep your requests up to ya till next week guys see you later thanks for watching setup ",

    "transcript": "how's it going everyone we good happy Friday and uh it's play a long time it's fun time and uh I'm back on an urban world this is the second episode hope you enjoyed the first one it was no moving around which suits this uh map perfectly oh look he's changed his name back mappa so we know it was definitely him score to be 18626 that was achieved last week which was pretty good um in particular a couple of rounds in particular one round in Israel I got a perfect score so there is potential on this because of all the clues around you to get a perfect score um which is makes it really interesting all all be it a little longer um if you want to play around um if you want to play around if you want to play along even if you want to play around you can do that too just not both at the same time I beg you um no if you want to play along uh the link will be in the description best way to play because I haven't mentioned it um personally to you only in the description is to play the first round switch tabs watch me do it and vice versa keep repeat that process that's just the best way to do it cuz it doesn't spoil the video and it doesn't spoil the game that's it let's do this don't need to set a time limit just need to copy that but I must remember to paste that URL after the game that would be catastrophic right here we go again then let's see what Clues we have today is that a flag it is isn't it and it looks like it could be the Thailand one you know that one that represents Thailand um let's have a look at the people they're probably not the best clue to look at but I just like looking at them um okay Vita Rea not very thae things really ly is that Roman numerals or does it just say lindex I don't know is this okay here are some better Clues I think right retn Mia is playing that's funny oh years and years I thought that said tears and fears Gabrielle Nico who's that Mark Bo I don't know they're getting too small and insignificant I can't read the other ones um but Mia I remember one of you commented only about two days ago saying how can you be slating mere Paper Planes you know it is a fairly good tune to be fair I guess I just took a disliking to it when I was younger because it was always playing now what is this Norway Arctic race why was I thinking Thailand why was I I guess it was this thing here this is clearly not Thailand is it and uh if we look at the flag again okay in my defense is pretty furled up so this is can't believe I thought Norway was Thailand can we just can we just smooth over that okay is it going to give away where we are yes it is tromo 12th to 13th of August the month is irrelevant so this is this is definitely tromo okay we can get this we can get this spot on touch wood let's not jinx it let's get in the map though first pretty sure trumpo is very far north there it is look so we are looking across this Bay here um let's find there's the bridge I think that you can see there that's a very tall bridge I'm guessing so that ships can pass underneath it um now we are on a square we could be on this one let's look at the pattern in the middle yes I think you'll find that that is where we are you've even got the little render of that King Haron statue which funnily enough sounds a bit tie right Town Hall yes that's what I was uh hoping for that we were next to the town hall we can be we can afford to be pretty far off on this um you know 100 meters or so but let's not be let's try not to be I think we're about there 4.4 that'll do gives me peace of mind to know that we would have got the full points no matter what the strictness okay we're in Asia for our second round well done if you got full marks on the first round you'll be feeling very pleased for yourself pleased with yourself you'll also be thinking damn I thought geoga wizard might have screwed up there but no it was on a plate for us wasn't it really um okay we have tall buildings here in what could be a number of places of course I famously am completely unable to differentiate Japan with Taiwan Grande Mari see I don't think they would have no this isn't is this Japan look at the writing is that Japanese writing let's have a look let's have a quick look I think that looks more Japanese than any other one that I've seen but let's have a look at um uh South Korea Korea just quickly no it's South Korean isn't it I think Okay so we've got that kind of in our minds um if we could see a flag that would be fabulous are we driving on the left we are driving on the left I think or are we yeah we are now do they drive on the left in career I don't think that I know I think that I have known that but at the moment I don't think I do so I'm kind of back to square one um sugar me sugar me up I'm just no good with with Asian places man I'm hopeless I get all flued right we're going to have to look at this sign here and I'm going to look for some of these signs in Japan I think now that we are probably in Japan because I'm pretty sure I got mixed up with uh South Korea and Japan one time and loads of you commented saying dude they drive on the left in Japan you numbnut and I knew that and that's what was so annoying yeah this is looking Japanese now so um where do I go where do I go that is the question well let's look at the the the sort of F and stuff like that I do I go Tokyo do I play it safe lots of you will go Tokyo I think and play it safe that is playing it safe for a couple of reasons a it's right in the middle of Japan which is a long thin country and there's real potential for crap scores the other reason it's playing it safe is just CU well it's the capital it's the biggest most populated place um I'm always tempted to go for [ __ ] you okay um I am going to go now there's mountains over there I think so that is making me change my mind about going on the North Coast um oh here's an idea is this all built after 1960 I think it is uh after the after the the World War II I am going to go for Hiroshima why not why the freak not let's go for it where am I going I'm going there fingers crossed oh my God no way no way mate no way you are joking Not only was it Hiroshima it was two blocks away I do not believe that I fail to believe it people are going to be thinking I I I speak Japanese you know I don't but 366 yards 4999 points that's probably the most insane guess I've done isn't it it's one of them it's definitely one of them let's carry on I've got a wow oh God I'm GNA yeah right okay next one AO tickets tickets is that Spanish can I even concentrate on this round after that I don't even know I'm glad I didn't go up by that square bit of water um right par toos maras I think this is Spanish and not Brazilian um let's keep looking let's hope that there's a a decent clue I can't believe I've got 9999 points what the hell right Cito okay oh that looks a bit no it doesn't look Brazilian Portuguese no it doesn't as is perfectly common in the Spanish world right I'm just praying for somewhere that can give away where we are that's what I'm praying for that's what you're always praying for on this particular format a clue that's going to give it away although didn't seem to matter in the last round did it okay ano God everyone's going to think I've just somehow cheated there oh God okay come on give me a sign no nothing really that I can see that is giving this away shall I maybe I should just go into my usual mode of just judging it going with my heart um Del [Music] oriente where what kind of place loves motorbikes and that's annoying because I'm pretty sure that has some good info on it um right guys I think I've got to think about wrapping up here sorry if this is my making you giddy all this movement but I've got to just keep I can't leave any stone unturned really right what am I thinking I'm thinking Colombia is what I'm thinking um possibly you know Ecuador something like that is there anything flags have I looked for Flags H hell h could be arent could it be Argentina I guess it could be right I'm going to look up for Flags now just quickly we're spinning round again p pa a z laaz surely that's why you keep scanning around guys CU you might just miss something has that given this away is this laaz I'm just going to look for some potential Bolivian colors somewhere but that is the ticket well these are Bolivian covers colors covers uh yeah yellow red green they are the colors are they not um I'm I think I'm going to go for it I'm going to go for lapaz my God okay let's do this that'll be really misleading if uh if this isn't if that wasn't actually referring to lapaz but hey I've got no better option to go for and this could feasibly be Bolivia so let's do it um right let's get in there oh we've got mountains haven't we to quickly look at where were they mountains over there in the north so if we're in laaz we're on a on an edge of it that has mountains over to the north so what about about here how about here I'm going for it this corner here come on no man a I wanted to go for Colombia damn the bugger that put that up there on that roof why did you do that mate where is that thing it was to the South wasn't it pass there's nothing there's there's yeah not even a a hostile or anything called pass unless I'm looking at the wrong direction for [ __ ] sake 855 a woful score it is fair to say that has really put a uh a spanner in the works really well just a downer on it actually let's carry on though fraking hell at least I got that insane round in Japan um which is going straight on um thingy bob guesses right sorry I'm trying to concentrate partia delices okay well there we go we're in Ria laa not necessarily on that street though unless we can see a shop that says the same thing but it looks like we are in Ria can we get a road name doesn't look like we can at the moment but I'm looking North partika delicatess well Vis visalo visu I think that says can we see if that is this road I don't think it is no I don't think it is I can't really see but I don't think it is um we're going to have to try and go on some other stuff I'm spinning in circles again so it looks like we're on a main road with a tram line on it or at least uh you know a tram route uh there's a park over there which looks quite big if you look at how far the trees go on for um and down here we've got some pretty big buildings now Ria is Big it's not that big though so maybe we can maybe we can do this drogus also we might be able to although we can't read it we might be able to use that okay let's get to R now the coast is kind of to the north but we can't see that of course let's get in there and see if we can find this road it's not really a yeah the coast isn't you know it's not on the coast it's on the river so which side would we be on I think we are literally it is North slightly Northeast doesn't really correlate with much of the roads here so what about in the south over the river how about that could potentially be here no no no no couldn't be couldn't possibly be um I hope we are in reer and that that van hasn't traveled far and wide to get to where we are I doubt it now could we be here I wonder Whoops a Daisy nobody saw that therefore that did not count as moving let's see if we can pair this up that could be that which would put us drogus got it okay good we found it right we've got to get this well reasonably spot on where's this building I can hardly see it I'm going there I can't be yeah okay I've got the points next one last round I've got to end on a high here if I'm going to get a really outstanding score Capital certifiers what does that say doesn't say where it's based we've got English writing there of course render we've even got a website there dot can't read it cannot read it um okay we are driving on don't know yet the left driving on the left interesting so what are we thinking then about that is that does that mean we're in Australia could be couldn't it where's the sun I think the sun is is it over there or am I just wanting that to be the case no I right let's look at these Shadows it's very hard to yeah it's very hard to gauge these Shadows let's look at the tree trunks can we see any tree trunk Shadows I think they're right down the sun is right above us I think oh that's an interesting one are there any other Shadows oh yeah the yeah the sun is right above us to be fair um well to be honest that wouldn't really have much much consequence anyway because Australia and South Africa are both in the Southern Hemisphere and I'm pretty sure that's the only places we can be danger deep excavation can we see does that say Oz a there look I don't know Capital certifi does that mean we're in cber do we go Cur that's an interesting thought how green is CRA I'm going to have to go for this guys because there's no other Clues and the only clue I've got to go on is capital certifiers so I'm going to go for canra um I feel like this is the kind of place that mappa would put in but ultimately I'm at the mercy of the round here um yeah let's uh pick a road that is heading slightly that way is it curving it kind of is so let's go for this one then Captain Cook cresant no that's two it's a dual Carriage Way let's go Walker Cresent then can you imagine can you imagine if I repeat the feat that happened in the first round here we go oh my God I don't believe it 1.4 miles didn't quite top the first round but how could I ever I am amazed at that obviously I mean there's no way that that um Capital contractors wasn't relating to CRA absolutely no way so I you know I owe it all to that clue I wonder how many more of you also did that you know absolutely sure that it was Australia and then used the capital clue I would love to know um wow let's view the summary 2846 I expect that some of you will have beaten me in it's just this round Ain it that's boogered me over 800 points I got I mean yeah I yeah well done to anyone who beat me in the other rounds anyway is what I'm saying um 2846 well we smashed last week's score and set a new record for this particular format um but yeah these two rounds what can I say about this I think that that has to go down as just pure luck to be honest even when I was suggesting that all the buildings might be new post World War II I was quietly thinking to myself yeah what do you on about mate most City Center buildings are going to be new aren't they and then that happened chaos right all that's left to say I think is thanks so much for watching and playing along let me know how you guys did in the comments section I love reading through your comments to see how you did step by step it's really interesting to see how you guys have done and tell your friends let's get more people involved thanks guys till next time t ",
